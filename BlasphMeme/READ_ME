FUNCTION 8 = RASTRIGIN
FUNCTION 9 = ROTATED RASTRIGIN
Therefore, the two function have been merged into one F_{8-9} (implementation-wise I just skipped f_8)


FUNCTION 10 = SCHWEFEL
FUNCTION 11 = ROTATED SCHWEFEL
Therefore, as before.


CF01 still have to decide if the second evaluation of ellipct function must be rotated or not
